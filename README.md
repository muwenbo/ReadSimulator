ReadSimulator
=============

Simulate artificial reads for NGS sequencing.

1.0 
Generated single-end or paired end reads.
Add SNPs to simulated reads.
Add sequencing error ot simulated reads.

1.1
Add argument parser.
SNPs are tractable from reads name.
Reads sequencing quality score are dynammic.

1.2
